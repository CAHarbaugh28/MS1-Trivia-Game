# MS1-Trivia-Game
Pepardy trivia game played with 2 players taking turns to answer questions from 4 categories (Movies, The Office Tv show, Geography, and Random), with 3 different questions in each one ranging from $250, $750. As you play and get questions right your score it totaled in the top left for player one and top right for player two, along with text that will appear under the players name when it is their turn.
